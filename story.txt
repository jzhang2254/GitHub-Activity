  Timothy just turned 10 yesterday, and he can't wait to tell his mom the big decision he just made. This morning, he walked up to his mother, and said "Hi mom, I'm 10 now, and
  I want to be a pokemon trainer! Please let me go on an adventure along for a couple of months with a bunch of strangers" "Ok." Without any hesitation, mom replied, as if it's
  normal for a 10-year-old to do such things. Shortly after, Timothy departed happily with his newly captured charmander.
  
  (Andy Lin) When Timothy exited his house he was met by his rival Alex. Timothy and Alex both looked at eacother's hand and realized they both had a pokeball. Timothy challenged Alex to a duel but realized he was in a predicament. Alex had chosen Squirtle as his starter, which was a water type and countered his charmander. As expected, Timothy lost the fight and Charmander was in critical condition. Timothy ran to the poke center but was stopped by Professor Oak.

  (Donghao Li) Professor Oak asked Timothy  to choose from one of three Pokemons: Mudkip, Treecko, and Trochi. Timothy picked Mudkip and started his trip to challenge Gym. Timothy
  then had battle using his new Pokemon and won. After, Professor Oak gave him a handy gadget: the Pokedex!. This high-tech encyclopedia instantly records information on any Pokemon you see or catch. He also received some Poke Balls to start off Timothy's adventure.
