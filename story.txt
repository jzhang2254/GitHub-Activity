  Timothy just turned 10 yesterday, and he can't wait to tell his mom the big decision he just made. This morning, he walked up to his mother, and said "Hi mom, I'm 10 now, and
  I want to be a pokemon trainer! Please let me go on an adventure along for a couple of months with a bunch of strangers" "Ok." Without any hesitation, mom replied, as if it's
  normal for a 10-year-old to do such things. Shortly after, Timothy departed happily with his newly captured charmander, but little did he know the illegal pokemon trafficking
  business he'll get invloved with.
